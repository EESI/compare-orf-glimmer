Gene Prediction Lab
(Adapted from Morgan Langille)

Finding genes in a genome is not a trivial task. As we have seen in class, a signigficant level of sophistication is required to complete this task. In this laboratory, you will get the opportunity to work directly with genome files and implement a simple gene prediction algorithm. The performance of this algorithm will then be evaluated with the assumption that the output from GLIMMER3 is completely accurate.
As you will soon see, prokaryotic genomes can be treated as any other FASTA file. You can regard a whole genome as a string.

Here is an overview of the lab:
